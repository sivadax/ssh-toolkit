### Create SSH Keys for your github account

```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@yourdomain.com"
  eval $(ssh-agent -s)
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### How To Set Up SSH Keys

Step 1 â€” Creating the Key Pair

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

or

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

output 

```
Output
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/sammy/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/sammy/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/sammy/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:EGx5HEXz7EqKigIxHHWKpCZItSj1Dy9Dqc5cYae+1zc sammy@hostname
The key's randomart image is:
